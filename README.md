# Swarmball.ai
## Short description of the idea

Swarmball.ai is a project based on real-life  problem of adapting the robotic tool to the environment when the task is to simply move some objects around. We have noticed, that there may be a more **versatile** approach.

### Go nanobots

We will be working on a simplified problem using only two dimensions. Instead of one robot, we will be using the swarm of small balls with an ability to move right or left. Their task is defined as follows: *Move the object to the far right wall*
