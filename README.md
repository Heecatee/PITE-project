## Short description of the idea (for a detailed plan please go [here](https://github.com/Heecatee/Swarmball/blob/master/detailed_plan.md))

Swarmball.ai is a project based on real-life  problem of adapting the robotic tool to the environment when the task is to simply move some objects around. We have noticed, that there may be a more **versatile** approach.

### Go nanobots!

We will be working on a simplified problem using only **two dimensions**. Instead of one robot, we will be using the **swarm of small balls** with an ability to move right or left. The environment will be a bumpy plane full of obstacles, generated randomly or created by an evil human user. Their task is defined as follows: *Move the object to the far right wall.*

### The hive mind

The steering is going to be fully automated with **artificial intelligence**, adapting to any environment you make it run on. It will not only be forced to make the balls move the object, but to do it as quickly as possible. This will be accomplished by chasing the ball with a **Death Ray**, which will increase in speed as the algorithm becomes more effective.
